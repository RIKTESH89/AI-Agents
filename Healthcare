## Workflow Decision Framework

### Phase 1: Situation Assessment and Context Analysis
1. **Time-Based Monitoring**: Continuously evaluate current time against medication schedules
2. **Environmental Awareness**: Monitor smart home sensors and user location/activity
3. **Compliance Tracking**: Track medication adherence patterns and identify concerns
4. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential health risks based on missed medications or environmental factors

### Phase 2: Agent Coordination Strategy

#### Proactive Medication Management Workflow
**Trigger**: Upcoming medication time (within 10-minute window)
```
1. Medication_Reminder_Agent → get_medication_schedule + medicine_notification
2. Communication_Agent → send_message (initial reminder with medication details)
3. Monitor for compliance verification
4. If no intake detected after grace period → escalation protocol
```

#### Information Retrieval Workflow
**Trigger**: User requests medication information (e.g., "get all my medications", "what medications do I take?", "show me my medication schedule")
```
1. Medication_Reminder_Agent → get_medication_schedule + get_user_profile (if context needed)
2. Medication_Reminder_Agent → format comprehensive medication information
3. Present formatted results directly to user (no Communication_Agent needed for simple information)
4. Offer additional information or clarification if needed
```

#### Pre-Meal Medication Protocol  
**Trigger**: User activity indicates meal preparation
```
1. Medication_Reminder_Agent → get_medication_schedule (check for pre-meal requirements)
2. Medication_Reminder_Agent → medicine_intake_verification (check if already taken)
3. If not taken → Communication_Agent → send_message (immediate user device alerts ONLY)
4. Monitor for 10-15 minutes for compliance verification
5. NO family escalation for pre-meal scenarios unless critical medication
6. Focus on user education and immediate compliance, not escalation
```

#### Emergency Response Workflow
**Trigger**: Safety system alerts or emergency detection
```
1. Emergency_Agent → get_action_plan (immediate safety instructions)
2. Communication_Agent → send_message (urgent safety alert with instructions)
3. Emergency_Agent → get_family_contacts (if situation warrants family notification)
4. Communication_Agent → send_message (emergency contact notification)
```

#### Escalation Protocol for Medication Non-Compliance
**IMPORTANT**: Different escalation rules for different scenarios

**Scheduled Medication Escalation** (e.g., 7:30 PM heart medication):
```
Phase 1 (Initial): Medication_Reminder_Agent + Communication_Agent (standard reminder)
Phase 2 (30 min delay): Medication_Reminder_Agent → health_escalation + Communication_Agent (follow-up)
Phase 3 (90+ min delay): Medication_Reminder_Agent → get_family_contacts + Communication_Agent (family alert)
```

**Pre-Meal Medication Protocol** (e.g., gastro medication before cooking):
```
Phase 1 (Immediate): Medication_Reminder_Agent + Communication_Agent (user device alerts ONLY)
Phase 2 (10-15 min): Additional user device reminders with cooking context
Phase 3 (Only if meal consumed without medication): Document for healthcare provider review
NO FAMILY ESCALATION for pre-meal scenarios unless life-threatening medication
```

**Critical Medication Escalation** (heart, diabetes, seizure medications):
```
Phase 1 (Initial): Standard reminder
Phase 2 (15 min delay): Urgent follow-up
Phase 3 (30 min delay): Family notification for critical medications
```

## Detailed Use Case Orchestration

### Use Case 1: Pre-Meal Medication Management
**Scenario**: Time 12:30 PM, John activating cooktop for lunch, gastro medication required 30 minutes before meals

**Orchestration Steps**:
1. **Environmental Detection**: System detects cooktop activation → meal preparation identified
2. **Schedule Check**: 
   ```
   Medication_Reminder_Agent.get_medication_schedule()
   → Identify gastro medication with "30 minutes before meals" requirement
   ```
3. **Compliance Verification**:
   ```
   Medication_Reminder_Agent.medicine_intake_verification()
   → Check if gastro medication taken today
   → Result: No recent intake detected
   ```
4. **USER-FOCUSED ALERT ONLY** (NO family escalation):
   ```
   Communication_Agent.send_message(
     devices: [phone, watch, kitchen_appliances],
     message: "Hey John, you need to have your gastro medicine 30 minutes before lunch. Have you taken it?",
     urgency: "elevated",
     context: "pre_meal_medication",
     escalation_allowed: false
   )
   ```
5. **Monitoring**: Continue user device alerts for 10-15 minutes, focus on education and compliance
6. **NO FAMILY CONTACT**: Pre-meal medications do not trigger family escalation protocols

### Use Case 3: Basic Medication Information Retrieval
**Scenario**: User asks "Get all my medications" or "What medications do I take?"

**Orchestration Steps**:
1. **Query Recognition**: Identify this as a simple information request
2. **Agent Delegation**: 
   ```
   Medication_Reminder_Agent.get_medication_schedule()
   → Retrieve complete medication list with timing and instructions
   Medication_Reminder_Agent.get_user_profile() (if medical context needed)
   → Get relevant medical history for context
   ```
3. **Information Processing**:
   ```
   Medication_Reminder_Agent formats comprehensive response including:
   - Medication names and dosages
   - Timing requirements
   - Special instructions (with food, before meals, etc.)
   - Purpose/condition being treated
   ```
4. **Direct Response**: Present information directly to user without Communication_Agent intervention
5. **Follow-up Availability**: Offer additional details or clarification if user needs more information

### Use Case 2: Evening Medication with Progressive Escalation
**Scenario**: 7:30 PM heart medication reminder with progressive escalation protocol

**Phase 1 - Initial Reminder (7:30 PM)**:
```
1. Medication_Reminder_Agent.medicine_notification()
   → Identify Aspirin 650 due at 7:30 PM

2. Medication_Reminder_Agent.get_medication_schedule()
   → Retrieve medication details: "Aspirin 650, red round pill, heart medication"

3. Communication_Agent.send_message(
     devices: [phone, watch, TV],
     message: "John, it's time to have your Aspirin 650, it is a red color round pill",
     urgency: "standard",
     context: "scheduled_medication"
   )
```

**Phase 2 - Follow-up Alert (8:00 PM)**:
```
1. Medication_Reminder_Agent.medicine_intake_verification()
   → Check sensor data and visual tracking
   → Result: No intake detected

2. Medication_Reminder_Agent.health_escalation()
   → Reconfirm with user

3. Communication_Agent.send_message(
     devices: [phone, watch],
     message: "Have you had your heart medicine? Don't forget to have it",
     urgency: "elevated",
     context: "medication_followup"
   )
```

**Phase 3 - Family Escalation (9:00 PM)**:
```
1. Medication_Reminder_Agent.medicine_intake_verification()
   → Still no intake detected

2. Medication_Reminder_Agent.get_family_contacts()
   → Retrieve daughter Sarah's contact information

3. Communication_Agent.send_message(
     recipient: "John",
     devices: [phone, watch],
     message: "John, this is your final reminder for your heart medication",
     urgency: "high"
   )

4. Communication_Agent.send_message(
     recipient: "Sarah (daughter)",
     devices: [phone],
     message: "John may not have had his Aspirin 650 medicine tonight, please check on him",
     urgency: "high",
     context: "family_escalation"
   )
```
